Prediction of CAN for diabetic renal patients

The Project
This project solves the problem of predicting CAN in diabetic patients timely, in order to help patients control or even reverse this common yet critical diabetic     complication. It further proposes implementation steps for this solution. 

The Challenge:
There was a lack of proper datasets in this domain, which called for research on the topic on my part. I found a small dataset of 104 entries, and used python to extend it to 873 entries. Later, the EDA phase revealed a heavy imbalance in the dataset. To help balance the dataset, I used he SMOTE oversampling technique to expand on the minority data group.
